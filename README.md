Congregation
============

Congregation is a real time strategy game made in 8 days for the 7dRTS game
making competition as part of the Mini Ludum Dare 44

The game is based around the general ideas of the board game Carcassonne
by Hans Im Gluck.

How to play
-----------

To win the game you need to defeat all of your opponents minions. In order to
do that, you must build cities. A complete city will spawn more minions every
so often if you have one or more of your own in it. If different players also
have their minions in the city however, no extra spawning will occur.

Minions will travel along roads very quickly, along cities slightly slower and
very slowly along grass. You must build many cities and quickly, before one of
your opponents come and wipe you out.

Controls
--------

- W A S D or H J K L to move the view
- Scroll mouse wheel to zoom
- Left click (and drag) to select minions
- Right click to move them to that location
- Q and E will rotate the piece you are holding clockwise and anticlockwise respectively.

Note
----

This game is in very early Alpha and although playable (and dare I say it, quite fun),
please don't be too surprised it crashes on you.

Dependencies
------------

Congregation requires SFML 2.0 (and all of its dependencies) and SFGUI (with its dependencies).
